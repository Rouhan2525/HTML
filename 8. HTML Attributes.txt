[  HTML Attributes ]

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional 
information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

1. The href Attribute:

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:


2. The src Attribute:

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.


3. The width and height Attributes:

The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):


4. The alt Attribute:

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.


5. The style Attribute:

The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

6. The title Attribute:

The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element
